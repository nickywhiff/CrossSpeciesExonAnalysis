# CrossSpeciesExonAnalysis

Code and data to accompany <add paper details>

./data/
Contains the following raw data:
1. GFF3 files downloaded from Ensembl FTP (links here http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html/)
NB: files for mouse and human are too large so are not included here
2. GFF3 file for S.pombe downloaded from https://fungi.ensembl.org/Schizosaccharomyces_pombe/Info/Index
3. Whole exome sequencing capture regions for the UK Biobank capture downloaded from https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/refer.cgi?id=3803

./code/
Contains code for two analyses:
1. Assessing the proportion of exonic bases with different annotations
2. Assessing the overlap of human exonic bases with whole exome sequencing capture regions
